# React TypeScript Fake Text/Article Generator

In this repo I'm creating a custom useInfiniteScroll hook, and later some other experiments on pagination and accordians and custom hooks, all using the Rust fake article text generator I created here: https://github.com/JosephRodolfo/Random-Text-Generator-Actix-Rust. The goal is also to learn more Typescript.
